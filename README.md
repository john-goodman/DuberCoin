# DuberCoin
Repo for new version of DuberCoin
	
The düber token (DBR) will incentivize and improve information exchange in the cannabis community including consumers, retailers, labs, processors and growers. Examples are rewarding community members for providing product information and photos, submitting product reviews, participation in loyalty programs and interaction with advertising and other communication channels. Blockchain technology will measure and allocate growth in economic surplus throughout the supply chain as a result of increased information exchange across all network participants.

The DBR is an ETH blockchain cryptocurrency that can be used within the network to pay for goods and services provided by licensed cannabis businesses.
